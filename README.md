# Image Gallery

Welcome to the Image Gallery project! This is a simple gallery that fetches and displays images from Unsplash based on different categories.

## Features

- **Filter Images**: Browse images by categories such as All, Nature, Architecture, and Technology.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded as you scroll down.
- **Loading Indicator**: A loading animation appears while images are being fetched.


# Dependencies:
- **Unsplash API**: Used to fetch images. You need an API key for it to work. Replace this.apiKey in script.js with your own key.
